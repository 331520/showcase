            The Timeline is an interactive visualization chart to visualize events in time.
            The events can take place on a single date, or have a start and end date (a range).
            You can freely move and zoom in the timeline by dragging and scrolling in the Timeline.
            Events can be created, edited, and deleted in the timeline. The time scale on the axis is adjusted automatically, 
            and supports scales ranging from milliseconds to years.
            <p/>
            When the timeline is defined as editable, events can be moved to another time by dragging them.
            By double clicking, the contents of an event can be changed. An event can be deleted by clicking the delete button 
            on the upper right. A new event can be added in different ways: by double clicking in the timeline, 
            or by keeping the Ctrl key down and clicking or dragging in the timeline, or by clicking the add button 
            in the upper left of the timeline, and then clicking or dragging at the right location in the timeline.
